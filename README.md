## Introduction

This Python repository provides an implementation for JPEG image compression with both low and high compression modes. The script employs various transformations and compression techniques to optimize the file size of JPEG images while preserving acceptable image quality.

## Process

### [1] Encoder

### [2] Decoder


## Results

| Original Image (grayscaled) | Decoded Image (Lowly-Compressed) (5:1) | Decoded Image (Highly-Compressed) (10:1) |
|-|-|-|
| ![Original Image (grayscaled)](./output//original_image.jpg) | ![Decoded Image (Low-Compressed)](./output//LOW.jpg) | ![Decoded Image (Highly-Compressed)](./output//HIGH.jpg) |
